FoodGroups allows roommates to easily divide the costs of groceries among one another and to transfer funds straight between checking accounts. Now you don't have to deal with your roommate mooching off of your food. It also tracks current inventory to suggest recipes to cook at home.

## Grocery Shopping Made Simple
Living with multiple roommates poses problems when everyone goes to the store on their own and you end up with four tubs of butter in your fridge. With FoodGroups, a free app, you can easily communicate grocery purchases to avoid wasteful and redundant purchases. When roommates cook together and share meals, FoodGroups makes splitting the cost simple. 


## How does FoodGroups make grocery shopping easier?
