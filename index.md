FoodGroups allows roommates to easily divide the costs of groceries among one another and to transfer funds straight between checking accounts. Now you don't have to deal with your roommate mooching off of your food. 


## Grocery Shopping Made Simple
Living with multiple roommates poses problems when everyone goes to the store on their own and you end up with four tubs of butter in your fridge. With FoodGroups, a free app, you can easily communicate grocery purchases to avoid wasteful and redundant purchases. When roommates cook together and share meals, FoodGroup makes splitting the cost simple. 


## How does FoodGroups make grocery shopping easier?
- Scan Receipts to import purchases to the app
- View Purchases to see what food you have available
- Create shared grocery lists 
- Reuse grocery lists for regular purchases
- Split bills for ingredients used in homecooked meals
